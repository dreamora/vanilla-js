# Vanilla-js Sandbox

This is a personal experimentation sandbox for working with vanilla-js based frontends to better understand DOM 
performance and development patterns in the absence of any framework.

This is inspired by the learnings from using and digging into the great [Solid JS library](https://github.com/solidjs/solid)
that achieves fantastic performance without the use of any virtual DOM, simply by utilizing the present capabilities of
the DOM with a clean reactive approach.
